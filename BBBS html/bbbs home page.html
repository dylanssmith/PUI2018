            Two brothers were desperately homesick for the cinammon rolls 
            that their mom used to make.  So desperate, in fact, that they spent 
            nearly every weekend trying to perfect her recipe.  The result was a 
            cinammon roll so gooey, sticky, cinammon-y, but not too sweet, 
            that they had to share it with the world.
